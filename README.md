React store for easy, straightforward non-hiearchical usage and extension.

Intention of a project is to enable flat, broadcasting based state managment with configurable prioritization of renders. That, in combination with memoization of components without dependence on props, overcomes DOM based hiearchical system and supports more independent development philosophy.
